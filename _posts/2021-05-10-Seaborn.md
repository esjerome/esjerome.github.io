# Seaborn

Sometimes making graphs using libraries such as python's matplotlib can be very complicated even to generate graphs as simple as bar or linear diagrams; Seaborn is the ideal solution for this.

Seaborn is a library that runs on matplotlib but using a few simple commands we can generate the same graphs but in a simple and elegant way.

In this post I will explain some of the most commonly used commands that will be very useful when generating graphics in a simple way and in a very short time.
